## Introduction

Workspace Core is the enige used by [gedachtegoed/workspace](https://github.com/media-code/workspace).
You can use this package to ship your own organization wide project defaults and keep them up to date with a upstream repository.

Workspace's Fluent Integrations enable automation of **_linting_**, **_fixing_**, **_ci workflows_**, **_editor integrations_**, **_working with gitignore files_** & **_composer scripts_**. Using custom hooks you can pretty much automate any Integration setup or repetetive task. For example; You can even use it to automate setting up [IDE helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) integrations in your project.

The [Workspace](https://github.com/media-code/workspace) package itself is a predefined Portable Workspace you can use as a well thought out but opinionated baseline for your Laravel projects. If you don't plan on creating your own presets we recommend to start there.

## Portable Workspaces

If you'd like to roll out your own Portable Workspace you'd create a new composer package that uses the Workspace Core as a dependency. A template project & comprehensive API reference & guide is in the works.
